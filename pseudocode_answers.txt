Short Answer:


1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Answer: Programmers use pseudocode because it is a way to express to another person what you want an algorithm to do.  Pseudocode
allows one to express their ideas quickly and brainstorming in anticipation of actual coding.  Pseudocode's syntax makes it able
to be quickly understood too.


2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Answer: Nothing will happen since pseudocode is not meant to be understood by machines, only humans.


Programming Assignment:

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

Answer:

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
  PRINT first number
ELSE
  PRINT second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

Answer:

INIT count to 1
WHILE the count is less than or equal to 100
  PRINT count
  ADD 1 to count
END WHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

Answer:

CREATE function with specificEntry and entirePhoneBook as parameters
  FOR each phone book entry in entirePhoneBook
    IF that phone book entry equals specificEntry
      PRINT specificEntry
    END IF
  END FOR



4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function search(specificEntry, entirePhoneBook) {
  for(let i=0; i<entirePhoneBook.length; i++) {
    if(entirePhoneBook[i] === specificEntry) {
      console.log(specificEntry);
    }
  }
}
